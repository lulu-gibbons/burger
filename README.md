# Eat Da Burger!

## This is a restaurant app that lets the users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat and then eat them.

### Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app displays the burger on the left side of the page. Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button and when the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page and officially be devoured.

#### The app utilizes MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM and follows the MVC design pattern. Node and MySQL are used to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars is used to generate the HTML.

## NPM Packages Used

This app is powered by three **NPM packages**.

**Express** is used to handle routing for the apiRoutes.js and htmlRoutes.js files. It is a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for node.
**Express Handlebars** A lightweight templating system for Node. Building views in NodeJS by incorporating layouts, partials, and everything in between.
**Body-parser** is middleware which is software that acts as a bridge between an operating system or database and applications.
**MySQL** This is a node.js driver for mysql.
**Method Override** Lets you use HTTP verbs such as PUT or DELETE in places where the client doesn't support it.

**Still working on....**
Styling still needs work so that the burger names and buttons align correctly. Currently working on that and should be updated soon.
